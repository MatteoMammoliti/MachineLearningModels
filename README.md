## 🎯 About This Repository

For every project included here, you will find:
- **Clean & Documented Code:** Implementations using industry-standard libraries and best practices.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth visualizations to uncover hidden patterns and understand data distributions.
- **Critical Commentary:** My personal insights, statistical interpretations (e.g., assessing correlations, understanding inductive biases), and the reasoning behind each modeling choice.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks / Python Scripts

I am deeply committed to mastering the mathematical and practical foundations of Machine Learning. Every dataset presents a new puzzle, and I am passionate about refining my skills, questioning my assumptions, and learning how to extract actionable business value from raw numbers. I treat every error as a stepping stone and every visualization as an opportunity to ask better questions.
